# the_little_snake_game

This is a small project I implemented to have some C++ code to show to interested employers.
I on purpose picked something simple that would be doable within a day and after that is usable.
The project is easily extensible by creating a more sophisticated UI, improving the graphics or
add more walls, obstacles, etc.

I also picked a game because I have never implemented something like that and I wanted to learn something
from this tiny project too. For the same reason I picked [nana](http://nanapro.org/en-us/) as the graphics library.
I have never worked with it before and I wanted to give it a try. I also did not look up any online ressource on 
game programming or more specific on snake implementation. In a professional context, I would have done that first
and probably I would have found a way superior implementation of snake that can be taken as a basis. However, this
code should show a very brieft overview of what the code I write looks like.
Nevertheless, I was able to write this code within the time of a normal working day (although split over two days) 
and you can play a very rudimentary version of snake with it.

If you want to run the code, simply clone the nana repository into the nana folder at root level of the repo and 
then build the `snake` executable with CMake. I tested it on Ubuntu 18.04.
